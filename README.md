**DevOps Engineer and System Engineer are two distinct roles with different areas of focus, responsibilities, and skills required.**

**A System Engineer is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining an organizationâ€™s computer systems and infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network components. They are responsible for ensuring the reliability, security, and scalability of the systems they manage. They may also be involved in troubleshooting and resolving issues that arise in the systems they manage.**

**On the other hand, a DevOps Engineer focuses on the development, deployment, and operation of software applications in collaboration with the development and operations teams. They are responsible for automating the software development process, ensuring the reliability and scalability of applications, and managing the deployment process. They also work to improve the speed and efficiency of the development and deployment processes.**

**In summary, while both roles involve managing computer systems and infrastructure, a System Engineer focuses on the infrastructure itself, while a DevOps Engineer focuses on the software development and deployment processes.**
